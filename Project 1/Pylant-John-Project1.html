<!--Introduction-->
    <h2 id="intro">Slainte!</h2>
    <p>I am <em>"The Hop Hitter"</em>, but you can call me John. I am an avid enthusiast and advocate for craft breweries,
        with a focus in the Southeast region of the United States (U.S.). I have been exploring the world of craft beer for over a decade
        and have been a beer consultant for a few years now. <em>Hop Hitter</em> is just a pseudonym I chose to help people jar their
        memory. I began my venture as the <em>Hop Hitter</em> earlier this year when I was approached by PorchDrinking.com
        to write reviews and cover events for their spurning website. Since then, I have fallen more and more in love with the
        culture surrounding this exciting industry.</p>

    <h2 id="craft">What Is Craft Beer?</h2>
<!--Explanation-->
    <p>Craft Beer is not new. It has had a lot of time to evolve and become what it is today. Craft beer, as it is understood
        today, began in the 1980s with breweries like <em>Samuel Adams</em> and <em>Widmer Bros.</em> The Brewer's Association
        is collectively accepted to be the industry standard for the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.</abbr> when it
        comes to what defines craft beer and a craft brewery. Below is a list of their standards.</p>

<!--Hop Hitters Work-Subheading 2-->
<h2 id="Work">What I do</h2>
    <p>As <em>Hop Hitter</em>, I review beers, growler stations, breweries, festivals, and other events. Yes, it is a
        splendid gig. I love it! There are so many styles of beers out their to try and every brewer puts their own
        twist on each one. <em>Stouts, IPAs, Kolsches, Lagers, Pilsners, Scotch ales, Brown ales, Golden ales, Dopplebocks,
        Hefeweizens, Dubble ales, Triple ales, Quad ales, Goses, Flanders, etc.</em> The list goes on and on and on. I travel
        all over the southeast region picking up local and foreign beers and visiting local breweries and events
        interviewing brewer's and event organizers to help share the love of craft beer. Every beer, every brewery,
        everybody has a story.</p>

    <p>My reviews do not include a rating system. To be honest, I picked this concept up working with <em>Porchdrinking.com</em>.
        The idea is less about grading the beer and more about describing the experience. Rating a beer on a scale can
        be a very subjective task. This is best left to the learned judges who have trained for decades on what a beer
        style should taste, smell and feel like. There is not one beer that <i>everybody</i> likes.
        It is inevitable that someone is going to score a beer low, undeservedly. I try to share the aromas and flavors
        present while providing some back story for the beer, the brewery, or the style. Then I leave it to the reader
        to chose to give the beer a chance.</p>

    <p>I have visited breweries in various states, from New Mexico to Florida. All were fantastic in their own right and
        few fail to embody the core of craft beer. Nearly every craft brewery has an open door policy allowing patrons to
        visit and taste their beers. These guys love to show how they make beer and what they go through to get it on
        nearby restaurant tables and store shelves. They do this through beer tours, which most charge a minuscule amount
        for, but provide patrons with glassware and/or beer to take home, depending on the state laws. Some breweries have
        actual tasting rooms with gift shops that sell everything from coasters to T-shirts to dog leashes with their
        brewery name or staple beer plastered on them. Where state laws allow, patrons can also purchase beer at the brewery
        to either drink there or take home. Others have full fledged restaurants attached to the brewery. Some are run by
        the breweries, like <em>Palmetto Brewing Co.</em> in Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">SC</abbr>, and others
        are just symbiotic relationships between the restaurant owner and the brewery, like <em>Hourglass Brewery</em>
        and <em>Waco Tacos</em> in Longwood, <abbr title="Florida">FL</abbr>. If you have never visited a brewery and seen
        the fermentation tanks or the cellars full of oak or cedar barrels filled with aging beers, I highly recommend it.</p>

    <p>The next best thing to visiting a brewery and hearing the tale of it's beginnings is going to a festival. Here
        you meet LOTS of brewers from TONS of breweries. Each brewery in attendance brings 2-4 beers in either keg or
        bottle/can format. It really depends on the festival. Traditionally though, they are kegs. You walk along the
        festival, much a like a farmers market, sampling beers for FREE. I always recommend going to a festival to people
        who are new to good beer. This is a low cost way to try various styles of beers from different areas to identify
        which you prefer and could go without. Be sure to bring your wallet though. Their are always local food and
        product vendors to purchase delicious festival food and fun local products like beer soap, screen printed towels
        or t-shirts, and brewery gear.</p>

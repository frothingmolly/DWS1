//Main Title
<h1>Hop Hitter: The Who & The What</h1>
//Introduction
<p>Slainte! I am <em>"The Hop Hitter"</em>, but you can call me John. I am an avid enthusiast and advocate for craft breweries,
    with a focus in the Southeast region of the United States (U.S.). I have been exploring the world of craft beer for over a decade
    and have been a beer consultant for a few years now. <em>Hop Hitter</em> is just a pseudonym I chose to help people jar their
    memory. I began my venture as the Hop Hitter earlier this year when I was approached by the founder of PorchDrinking.com
    to write reviews and cover events for their spurning website. Since then, I have fallen more and more in love with the
    culture surrounding this exciting industry.</p>

<h2>What Is Craft Beer?</h2>
//Explanation
<p>Craft Beer is not new. It has a lot of time to evolve and become what it is today. Craft beer, as it is understood
    today, began in the 1980s with breweries like Samuel Adams and Widmer Bros. The Brewer's Association is collectively
    accepted to be the industry standard for the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.</abbr> </p> when it comes
    to what defines craft beer and a craft brewery.

//Main Title
<h1>Hop Hitter: The Who & The What</h1>
//Introduction
<p>Slainte! I am <em>"The Hop Hitter"</em>, but you can call me John. I am an avid enthusiast and advocate for craft breweries,
    with a focus in the Southeast region of the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.</abbr> I have been exploring the world of craft beer for over a decade
    and have been a beer consultant for a few years now. <em>Hop Hitter</em> is just a pseudonym I chose to help people jar their
    memory. I began my venture as the Hop Hitter earlier this year when I was approached by the founder of PorchDrinking.com
    to write reviews and cover events for their spurning website. Since then, I have fallen more and more in love with the
    culture surrounding this exciting industry.</p>
